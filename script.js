// To do list in this repository
// 1.- We can add a filter by ID or name, but for that we need to display the ID as well, but that's not too hard to be honest
// 2.- We can add a little bit of more style and improve the color scheme in order to improve the user experience.

//Create the function to fetch the list of repository

const listRepository = () => {
    const user = document.getElementById('userID').value;
    // const url = "https://api.github.com/users/VikiSevcikova/repos?"

           const status = resp.status;
           if(status !== 200){
               alert(`Sorry, something went wrong, try again error:${status}`) // I added this line for to let to know the user why the app didn't give back any response in case the fetch falis
               console.log(`Ops! Something is wrong ${status}`)
           }
